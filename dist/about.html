    <p>About Me</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>A younger Julia was always very passionate about sports, particularly softball. I played for 8 years and fell
        in
        love with the game. Today, I do not currently play, but get my fix for the sport watching baseball. Being the
        only
        Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays have my support.</li>
      <li>I pursued a Sociology degree at the University of British Columbia. Throughout my degree I was always
        interested
        in
        a wide breadth of courses. Some of which included: Family Studies, Chemistry, Biology, Math, Graphic Design,
        Visual
        Arts, Creative Writing, Psychology and Education. I loved learning about Sociology. I think it is so essential
        and
        important to understand the society we live in and how human interaction is structured based on the inequalities
        and
        social determinants within our society.</li>
      <li>Some of my favourite courses in University were statistics and research methods. I had always had a passion
        for
        technology, playing with HTML and CSS even before university. I sought out Lighthouse Labs to progress my
        knowledge
        in technology. Here I spent many hours learning and working in a 12 week intensive program to achieve full stack
        development. The course went surprisingly fast and before I knew it my resume looked a whole lot beefier (all
        jokes
        aside I learned some really cool things).</li>
      <li>When I am not coding, I like to spend my time cheering on my favourite sports teams, spending time with
        friends,
        snowboarding (or falling a lot), practicing photography, baking, watching terrible reality television, or
        sleeping,
        I really like sleeping.</li>
    </ul>
