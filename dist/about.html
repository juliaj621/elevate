    <p>About Me</p>
    <br>
    <p>A younger Julia was always very passionate about sports, particularly softball. I played for 8 years and fell in
      love with the game. Today, I do not currently play, but get my fix for the sport watching baseball. Being the only
      Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays have my support.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> I pursued a Sociology degree at the University of British Columbia. Throughout my degree I was always interested
      in
      a wide breadth of courses. Some of which included: Family Studies, Chemistry, Biology, Math, Graphic Design,
      Visual
      Arts, Creative Writing, Psychology and Education. I loved learning about Sociology. I think it is so essential and
      important to understand the society we live in and how human interaction is structured based on the inequalities
      and
      social determinants within our society.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> Some of my favourite courses in University were statistics and research methods. I had always had a passion for
      technology, playing with HTML and CSS even before university. I sought out Lighthouse Labs to progress my
      knowledge
      in technology. Here I spent many hours learning and working in a 12 week intensive program to achieve full stack
      development. The course went surprisingly fast and before I knew it my resume looked a whole lot beefier (all
      jokes
      aside I learned some really cool things).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> When I am not coding, I like to spend my time cheering on my favourite sports teams, spending time with friends,
      snowboarding (or falling a lot), practicing photography, baking, watching terrible reality television, or
      sleeping,
      I really like sleeping.
